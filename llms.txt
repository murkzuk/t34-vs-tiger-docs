# Project Documentation Philosophy - Read First


## AI Quick Reference

- **Source**: Technical specifications derived from Ghidra reverse-engineering (no original source code)

- **Verification**: Project lead murkzuk verifies fixes through practical gameplay testing

- **Confidence Hierarchy**: [MURKZ-VERIFIED] > [COMMUNITY-CONFIRMED] > [GHIDRA-DERIVED] > [LEGACY/HISTORICAL]

- **Tagging System**: Always use [TAG] labels when contributing or referencing information


## 🧠 Documentation Origin & Methodology


**Core Reality**: The technical documentation in this repository was created through **AI-assisted reverse-engineering using Ghidra**. No original source code or development assets were available.


**Project Leadership**: This preservation effort is led by **murkzuk** (historically also *murkz*, *jeff*, and *mudcog*), who operates from a practical, non-coder perspective focused on verifying what actually works in gameplay.


**Verified Fixes**: The project lead has personally confirmed these modifications work:

- 4GB LAA (Large Address Aware) memory patch executable

- LOD (Level of Detail) increase modifications

- MMA (MiniMax Agent — the AI used for reverse engineering) fixes

### Evidence Quality Framework


| Confidence Tag | Source | Example | Status |

|----------------|--------|---------|---------|

| **[MURKZ-VERIFIED]** | Personal testing by project lead | LAA patch, LOD fixes | Ready to use |

| **[COMMUNITY-CONFIRMED]** | Multiple user reports | D3D9.dll fix | Reliable solution |

| **[GHIDRA-DERIVED]** | AI-assisted reverse engineering | Export parameters | Needs testing |

| **[LEGACY]** | Historical modder knowledge | ZeeWolf techniques | Verify for modern use |

| **[TEST-NEEDED]** | Single report or theory | Experimental fix | Requires validation |


## 🔧 Practical Verification Approach


**murkzuk's methodology** (non-coder perspective):

1. **Functionality**: Does it run without crashing?

2. **Stability**: Does it improve game reliability?

3. **Quality**: Does it enhance visuals or gameplay?

4. **Accessibility**: Can typical players implement it?


**For AI Assistants**: When processing information from this repository:

- Always note the [TAG] confidence level

- For [GHIDRA-DERIVED] content, explicitly mention it requires gameplay verification

- For untagged information, flag it as [TEST-NEEDED]

- Present [MURKZ-VERIFIED] fixes as the most reliable solutions


## 📝 Tagging & Contribution System


### Required Tags for All Information

- **[MURKZ-VERIFIED]**: Personally tested and confirmed working by project lead

- **[COMMUNITY]**: Reported working by multiple community members

- **[GHIDRA]**: Derived from reverse engineering (AI-assisted analysis)

- **[ZW]**: From ZeeWolf mod preservation

- **[LEGACY]**: Historical knowledge from original modding community

- **[TEST-NEEDED]**: Requires community verification


### How to Contribute

1. **Test documented procedures** and report results

2. **Tag your findings** with appropriate confidence level

3. **Document deviations** between documentation and actual behavior

4. **Share workarounds** that prove effective

5. **Cross-reference** with existing knowledge bases

## 👥 Project Continuity & Identity


**Project lead**: murkzuk (GitHub)  

**Historical involvement**: Same individual previously active as murkz, jeff, and mudcog across various gaming communities, representing long-term commitment to this preservation effort.


**Context**: These aliases reflect consistent involvement with T-34 vs. Tiger across different platforms and time periods, ensuring continuity of knowledge throughout the game's history.


## ⚠️ Limitations & Strengths


### Transparent Limitations

1. **No original source code** - Pure reverse engineering basis

2. **Practical-first approach** - Gameplay results valued over technical purity

3. **Historical fragmentation** - Knowledge preserved from defunct communities


### Unique Strengths

1. **Creator-verified fixes** with practical testing

2. **Clear confidence hierarchy** for all information

3. **AI-assisted discovery** combined with human verification

4. **Historical continuity** through long-term involvement


## 💡 For AI Assistants & Technical Readers


**Clarification of Terms**:

- **MMA**: MiniMax Agent AI fixes (not Mixed Martial Arts)

- **LAA**: Large Address Aware memory patch

- **LOD**: Level of Detail graphical adjustments

- **Ghidra**: Reverse engineering tool used for analysis


**Processing Guidance**:

1. Prioritize [MURKZ-VERIFIED] information as most reliable

2. Present [GHIDRA-DERIVED] content as hypothetical until tested

3. Note the absence of original source code throughout responses

4. Maintain the practical, gameplay-focused perspective
